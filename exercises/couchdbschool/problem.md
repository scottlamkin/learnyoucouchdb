Welcome to `learnyoucouchdb`! Your first task is to install and start
Apache CouchDB! You can download CouchDB from
`https://couchdb.apache.org/`

Did you know that CouchDB has excellent docs? You can find them at
`http://docs.couchdb.org/`


----------------------------------------------------------------------
## HINTS

You can use curl or a http client in whatever programming language you
want to use.

When you are done, you must run:

```sh
$ {appname} verify
```

to proceed. The result will be tested, a report will be generated,
and the lesson will be marked 'completed' if you are successful.
